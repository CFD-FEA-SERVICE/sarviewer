# sarviewer

This repository is intended to give a simple way to measure resources usage (CPU, RAM...) in a machine. It uses sar to retrieve data and gnuplot (by default) or matplotlib to generate graphs from it.

Useful to visualize and analyze data during stress tests.

The following graphs based on sar data are generated:

* CPU usage
* Load average
* RAM usage
* I/O transfer
* Processes created per second
* Swap usage
* Context switches
* Tasks (run queue, active, blocked)
* Network interface statistics (eth0 by default)

## Requirements

* Install **sysstat** and **gnuplot** in your system using your package manager:
```bash
# Debian & based
apt-get install sysstat gnuplot
# RHEL & based
yum install sysstat gnuplot
```
        
* If you want to generate the graphs using **matplotlib** (in **Python 2.7**) you can install it with **pip**. In case you don't have pip [check the official guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/#using-linux-package-managers) to install it using your chosen package manager. Once you have pip just:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

* Clone this repo or download it (ZIP format). Note that the files contained in data/ and graphs/ folders are only for sample purposes.
* By default the graphs are generated using gnuplot. If you want to generate them using matplotlib, change the variable **GRAPH_GENERATOR** in the script **plotter.sh** from *gnuplot* to *matplotlib*
* Network interface statistics are generated for eth0 by default. Change the variable **network_interface** as needed in **data_collector.sh** and **system_data_reader.sh** scripts.
* The repo can be used in two modes, depending on your needs. See below.

### Mode 1: Begin collecting data and generate graphs

* Useful for stress tests. Launch the **data_collector.sh** script if you want to begin collecting data. Specify the number of samples and interval to take each sample. Notice that whenever you want you can cancel the collector with *Ctrl+C*, interrumpting the collection of data. If it is cancelled you will need to launch the script **plotter.sh** manually. The data and graphs generated will overwrite the samples given in this repo in **data/** and **graphs/** folder respectively.

```
[jota@myserver sarviewer]$ ./data_collector.sh 
Please specify the number of samples to take-> 10
Please specify the sample interval (take sample every X seconds)-> 5
Total time to collect data -> 50 seconds
>>>Collecting data...
>>>Please wait until data collection is completed...
You can abort this script with Ctrl+C, but have in mind the data will stop being collected when you cancel it.
You will also need to manually launch script plotter.sh to generate the graphs.
```

* Once the script has finished the data collection or you have cancelled it (and subsequently launched plotter.sh) you can analyze the resource usage in the graphs (PNG format) that have been generated in the **graphs/** folder of this repo.

### Mode 2: Read data from sar daemon and generate graphs

* If you just want to read the data already generated by sar daemon in your system, use the script **system_data_reader.sh** and choose the sa* file you want to parse to generate the corresponding graphs. Remember that sar daemon should have been previously enabled in **/etc/default/sysstat**

```
[jota@myserver sarviewer]$ ./system_data_reader.sh
